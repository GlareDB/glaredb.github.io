## FAQs

### How much does it cost? Are there any commitments?

There is no minimum commitment. The plan is entirely pay-for-what-you-use. If
your usage falls within the free limits, then you arenâ€™t charged.

- $7 per TB of data processed
- $23 per TB of data stored

### How does billing work?

Invoices are created at the end of the month. Depending on your timezone, you
will receive it either on the last day of the month or the first day of the
following month.

### What if I use all the storage in the free tier?

Your sessions will become read-only. To write more data, either drop existing
native tables or upgrade to the Pro plan.

### How do I know how much data will be processed per query?

GlareDB Cloud records the amount of data read and the size of the output written
per query. EXPLAIN reports expected query input size and is a good estimation.
Some storage formats are more efficient for limiting the amount of data a query
needs to read: parquet only needs to read the data in the exact field read, and
can skip all other columns and data, while queries for PostgreSQL and MySQL are
pushed-down to their respective backing stores.
