# Release notes

Each release corresponds to the version of [console.glaredb.com]. The underlying
database of GlareDB deployments is independently versioned. Updates to the
database are captured in the release notes at the top, so for example:

> `glaredb@x.y.z`

[console.glaredb.com]: https://console.glaredb.com
