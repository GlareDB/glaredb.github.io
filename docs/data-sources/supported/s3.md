# S3

CSV and Parquet files in S3 storage are able to be used as an external data
source.

## S3 file as an external table

CSV and Parquet files can be added as an external table through the
[CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE] command.

> `table-name` will be the name of the database inside GlareDB. `table-name` may
> optionally be qualified with a schema name.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE <table-name>
 FROM s3
 OPTIONS (
  access_key_id = '<access-key-id>',
  secret_access_key = '<secret-access-key>',
  region = '<region>',
  bucket = '<bucket>',
  location = '<location>'
);
```
