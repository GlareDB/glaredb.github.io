# Data sources

In GlareDB, data sources are the backends that hold your data,
including files, object stores, and external database systems, and
the GlareDB-native storage engine based on DeltaLake.

When you add a data source to GlareDB, you can access that data source
as a table or database from any SQL query, and join the contents of
that source with any or all of your other sources.
