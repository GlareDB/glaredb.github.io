# Plans and billing

Billing information for an organization can be found in **Settings -> Billing**.

## Free plan

GlareDB offers a free plan to allow for exploration and hobby usage of the
platform. This plan is limited in the number of resources that can be used, and
the number of data sources that can be hooked into GlareDB.
