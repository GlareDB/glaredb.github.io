# Managing passwords

{: .important}

> Passwords are only shown once (when they are generated). Afterwards, only the
> username associated to the password can be viewed.

Connecting to a deployment using an external client requires a username and
password combination. Credentials for a deployment can be viewed by going to a
deployment's **Settings** page and selecting the **Passwords** tab.

![Manage passwords]

From this tab, you'll be able to see all of the credentials for a deployment
including when they were created, and when they were last used. A credential may
also be deleted from this tab. When a credential is deleted, all future
connection attempts using that credential will fail with an unauthenticated
error.
