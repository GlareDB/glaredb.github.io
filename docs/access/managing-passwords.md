# Managing passwords

Connecting to a deployment using an external client requires a username and
password combo. Credentials for a deployment can be viewed by going to a
deployment's **Settings** page and selecting the **Passwords** tab.

![Manage passwords]

From this tab, you'll be able to see all passwords for a deployment, when they
were created, and when they were last used. Password may also be deleted from
this tab. When a password is deleted, all future connection attempts using that
password will fail with an unauthenticated error.
