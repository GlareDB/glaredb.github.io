# What is GlareDB?

<!-- markdownlint-enable title-case-style -->

GlareDB is a database that provides a single SQL interface across your data
sources. With GlareDB, you can query Postgres, MySQL, BigQuery and much more
using basic SQL commands you already know and use.

## Where does GlareDB fit into your stack?

GlareDB sits between your data applications and your data sources. Any
application or client that can communicate using the PostgreSQL protocol can
connect directly to GlareDB.
