## What is GlareDB?

Data lives everywhere, as files on laptops, servers, and [S3], or in
other database systems like [Postgres], [Snowflake], and
[MongoDB]. Data lives in many formats, like [Excel], [CSV] and
[Parquet]. And this is just the beginning.

_GlareDB is a tool that
recognizes that it makes sense to store and work with data in
different systems_, and provides a system for querying, manipulating,
and storing data in the best way possible.

**GlareDB makes all of your data SQL addressable, no matter what form
it's in.**

So you can query (and `JOIN`!) and manipulate your data
using standard tools that you may already know.
