# What is GlareDB?

<!-- markdownlint-enable title-case-style -->

GlareDB is a database that provides a single SQL interface across various data
sources. With GlareDB, you can query Postgres, MySQL, BigQuery and much more
using basic SQL commands you already know and use.

![Where GlareDB fits]

GlareDB sits between your data applications and your data sources. Any
application or client that can communicate using the PostgreSQL protocol can
connect directly to GlareDB.

## Why GlareDB?

<!-- markdownlint-enable title-case-style -->

GlareDB is designed to make "time to first insight" as quick as possible.
Instead of having to rely on ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines to move data
across databases, GlareDB hooks directly into your data sources. Data scientists
and analysts no longer have to wait on an ETL pipeline before being able to work
on the freshest data.
