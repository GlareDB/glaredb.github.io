# What is GlareDB?

GlareDB is a database providing a single, SQL interface across many different
data sources. A single GlareDB deployment can integrate with databases such as
Postgres, MySQL, and much more.

![Where GlareDB fits]

A GlareDB deployment sits between your data applications and your data sources. Any
application or client that can talk the Postgres protocol can connect directly
to GlareDB. Once connected, applications can start executing SQL queries that
interact with any number of data sources.

## Why GlareDB?

GlareDB is designed to make "time to first insight" as quick as possible.
Instead of having to rely on ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines to move data
across databases, GlareDB hooks directly into your data sources. Data scientists
and analysts no longer have to wait on an ETL pipeline before being able to work
on the freshest data.
