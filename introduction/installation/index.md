## How do I get it?

If you're working with data from Python or Node.js, you can get a
complete GlareDB with just:

```shell
pip install glaredb
```

or:

```shell
npm install glaredb
```

You can install an interactive terminal program `glaredb` with:

```shell
curl https://glaredb.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can sign up for [GlareDB Cloud], which provides fully managed and
entirely serverless deployments via the PostgreSQL protocol.

Don't worry! If you start using the embedded version of GlareDB and
later outgrow the confines of your laptop (or edge function!) moving
to GlareDB Cloud just requires adding a connection string!
