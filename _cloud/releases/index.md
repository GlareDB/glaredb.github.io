# GlareDB Cloud release notes

{: .important}

> As of August 2023, GlareDB Cloud will be switching to date-based releases

Each release corresponds to the version of [console.glaredb.com]. The underlying
database of GlareDB deployments is independently versioned. Updates to the
database are captured in the release notes at the top, so for example:

> `glaredb@x.y.z`
