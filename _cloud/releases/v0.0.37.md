# v0.0.37

<!-- markdownlint-enable title-case-style -->

Released on 2023-07-12

- [`glaredb@v0.2.0`](https://github.com/GlareDB/glaredb/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
- compute engines:
  - The 'Serverless' and 'Dedicated' concepts were re-architected into 'Compute Engines'
  - Free plans have access to a default compute engine and paid plans can create
    dedicated compute engines with customizable resources.
  - In the SQL Workspace, a compute engine can be chosen for the session
  - To connect to a specific compute engine using a connection string, replace
    the name of the database with `<compute_engine_name>.<database_name>`. For example,
    `postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<address>:6543/<compute_engine_name>.<database_name>`.
    If `<compute_engine_name>` is omitted, the default is used.
- misc:
  - Storage used by the deployment is now displayed on the Overview page
  - Scroll behavior and layout of SQL Workspace were improved
  - The application now loads with the last organization you use
  - Improvements to the user menu
  - Improvements to the layouts of various pages
