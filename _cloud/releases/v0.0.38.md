<!-- markdownlint-enable title-case-style -->

Released on 2023-07-17

- [`glaredb@v0.2.1`](https://github.com/GlareDB/glaredb/releases/tag/v0.2.1)
- Plans and billing:
  - We heard your feedback and removed the subscription fee for using GlareDB
    team plans. We now only bill on compute engine usage. Upgrading is handled
    by Stripe and only requires a valid credit card. There are no subscription
    fees or charges for upgrading.
  - The billing page and various UI was adjusted based on this change
- SQL Workspace:
  - Views were added to the schema explorer
  - The latest run query now persists across session. When you load up the
    editor, the last query you ran will be shown.
- Fixes:
  - Corrected account identifier validation when creating Snowflake data sources
