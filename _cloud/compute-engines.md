# Compute engines

Compute engines are virtual machines responsible for executing SQL queries and
accessing data sources. All GlareDB [Deployments] can access the default
serverless compute engine, which is available in our [Free Tier].

Compute engines can be viewed from the **SQL workspace** in the
**Compute engines** panel from the sidebar.

This feature is only available if a payment method is provided.

To turn on, off or restart your engine, select the option from the 3-dot menu.
