# Save a query

The **SQL workspace** offers two easy-to-use features: saving queries and
exporting results.

## Save queries as views

To save the most recently executed query, click the **Save view** button located
in the top of the results panel. A dialog will appear.

![Save as view]

If you want to use a schema other than `public`, create a new schema in GlareDB.
For more information, refer to [CREATE SCHEMA].

## Export results

To export results from the SQL workspace editor, first run a query. Then, click
**Export** in the top right of the results table.
