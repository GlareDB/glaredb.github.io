# GlareDB docs

Welcome to GlareDB documentation ðŸ‘‹.

## Feedback and issues

Have feature requests or bug reports for [console.glaredb.com]? We'd love to
hear from you - please [file an issue].

## Contributions

We welcome contributions and fixes to our documentation. For more information
on contributing, see our [Contributing guidelines].

## Development environment

GlareDB docs are built using [Just the docs]. The following are needed:

- [Ruby]
  - Also: [RubyGems] which can typically be installed alongside `ruby`
- GCC (`g++`)
  - `build-essential` APT package for debian and Ubuntu
- `make`

In addition to the documentation, we have some optional tooling for static
analysis. The following are needed:

- [Node.js LTS]
- [Yarn]

Once the above are installed, install [jekyll] and [bundler]:

```console
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Getting started

Install project dependencies:

```console
# From the project root
bundler install
```

Develop locally (`localhost:4000`):

```console
# From root of project
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Static analysis

We use `markdownlint` for linting and `prettier` for formatting. To see the
configurations, check out `.markdownlint.jsonc` and `.prettierrc.json`
respectively.

From the root of the project:

```console
# Checks code format
yarn format

# Attempts to automatically fix any formatting issues
yarn format:fix

# Checks code adheres to lint rules
yarn lint

# Attempts to automatically fix any lint violations
yarn lint:fix
```

### Adding plugins

Adding plugins:

- Add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "<plugin>"
```

- And add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - "<plugin>"
```
